Mamdani model:


It generally represents an estimation of COA by using a sample of n points, namely (xi,i = (1,2,3,4,5..n)

The input parameters will be the temperature and the humidity
For an input of 0(between very cold and cold) temperature and 100(wet) humidity, the output type will be short.

In this model, output variables belong to a fuzzy set. Therefore, result of evaluation is applied for the membership
function of the consequence.
The Madmani model consists of the rule evaluations, namely, evaluation of consequence.
