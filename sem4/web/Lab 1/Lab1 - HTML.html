                            <a href="http://www.justintimberlake.com"> Justin Randall Timberlake </a> (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, dancer, and record producer.
                            Born and raised in Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. 
                            In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually 
                            became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an artist with the release 
                            of his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which yielded the successful singles "<b>Cry Me a River</b>" and "<b>Rock Your Body</b>", 
                            and earned his first two Grammy Awards.

                            His critically acclaimed second album <b>FutureSex/LoveSounds</b> (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. 
                            Billboard 200 and produced the Hot 100 number-one singles "<b>SexyBack</b>", "<b>My Love</b>", and "<b>What Goes Around... Comes Around</b>". 
                            Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, and continued producing records 
                            and collaborating with other artists. From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; 
                            he held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.

                            Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, 
                            exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling 
                            album of the year in the US with the largest sales week, and spawned the top-three singles "<b>Suit & Tie</b>" and "<b>Mirrors</b>", while the latter 
                            produced the top-ten song "<b>Not a Bad Thing</b>". Throughout his solo career, Timberlake has sold over 32 million albums and 56 million singles 
                            globally, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. For his live performances, including the eponymous concert tour for the 
                            albums, he began performing with his band The Tennessee Kids, composed by instrumentalists and dancers. Timberlake voiced the lead character 
                            in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls (2016), which soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, "<b>Can't Stop the Feeling!</b>" 
                            His fifth studio album Man of the Woods (2018) became his fourth number one in the US.

                            Justin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, to Lynn (Bomar) Harless
                            and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director. Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest,
                            a small community between Memphis and Millington. He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born September 12, 1993)
                            and Stephen (born August 14, 1998), from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. His half-sister Laura Katherine 
                            died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as "My Angel 
                            in Heaven". His family circle includes a number of musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from 
                            country artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. Performing as a child, Timberlake sang country and gospel 
                            music: at the age of 11, he appeared on the television show Star Search, performing country songs as "Justin 
                            Randall". By that time, he began listening to rhythm and blues musicians from the 1960s and 70s, such as Al Green,
                            Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, and he had listening sessions with his father of studio albums by the Eagles and Bob Seger.
