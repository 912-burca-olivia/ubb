Command line redirections
-------------------------
        - pipe; pass the standard output of the prevois command as standard input of the next command
        - 0 -> standard input (where scanf or cin read from)
        - 1 -> standard output (where printf or cout write to)
        - 2 -> standard error ( 2> )
        > a.txt - redirect the standard output of the previous command to file a.txt
        2> a.err - redirect the standard error of the previous command in a.err
        > a.both 2>&1 - redirect both standard output and standard error to a.both
        >> a.txt - append standard output of previous command to a.txt
        < a.txt - use as standard input for the previous command the content of file a.txt
        
        ; - separate command on a line

Command line truth values
-------------------------
        0 = true
        non 0 = false
        && - logican and
        || - logical or

Shell programming
-----------------

- Varaibles - no types
            - A=5
            - B="asdf"
            - echo $A
            - echo ${A}cat (concatonates the value of A to 'cat')

note: Be careful with the spaces
      Shell is space sensitive 

 "..." - will allow substitution of variables and embedded commands
 '...' - will not allow substitution
        
 A Shell script is a text file containing Shell code and possibly a special first line, telling the interpretor how to use that code.
